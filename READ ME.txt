To replicate my setup you need to do the following
1. Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 
2. Installed Java JDK and JRE
3. Download Selenium
4. Download a ChromeDriver based on the Google Chrome version installed on your device.
5. After installing and downloading all the tools the I created a Java Project(QAExamPaulJohnPerez).
6. Created a Package(exam).
7. Created 5 Class that for the 5 cases on that Package(exam).
8. You need to add external jars of Selenium on the eclipse to add it you just need to right click the Package(exam) and build path(configure build path)
8. Go to the Libraries tab of the Java Build Path Window. Add all the external jar files from Selenium folder, Apply and Close.
9. I set the path of for chromedriver on my device to use the chromedriver. [System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","C:\\Users\\63948\\eclipse-workspace\\chromedriver.exe");]
10. I get the xpath by inspecting(F12) the website for each sorting choices that is needed to be test.
11. And you can now run the codes and see for the results
